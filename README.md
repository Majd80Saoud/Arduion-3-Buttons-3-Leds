# 3 Buttons & 3 LEDs Arduino Project

This project uses an Arduino Uno to control three LEDs using three push buttons. When you press a button, its corresponding LED lights up.

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Arduino Uno board  
- 3 × Push buttons  
- 3 × LEDs (any colors)  
- 3 × 220Ω resistors (for LEDs) ✅  
- 3 × 10kΩ resistors (for pull-down on buttons) ✅  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires


## 🧠 Project Logic

- When a button is pressed, the Arduino reads HIGH on the input pin.
- The corresponding LED turns ON.
- When the button is released, the LED turns OFF.
